## Purpose of this document
This document's purpose is to provide additional information about the ELIXIR Clearinghouse, to make it easier for ENA (and non-ENA) users to submit data to it. 
<br>
<br>
It is a supplement to the API document [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y1a4xQwCddntDkmY3qq1XvxtMUZAtW0h3RhEMo3Gtho/edit#heading=h.1ksv4uv), which contains more technical information regarding usage of the Clearinghouse API, so please ensure you read both before starting. The API document is the source of truth and will be more frequently updated than this one.    

## Introduction
The ELIXIR Clearinghouse enables extension, correction and improvement of publicly available annotations on sample, sequence, run/experiment and study records available in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) (and by extension, as the wider International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) databases). The overall aim is to make metadata more FAIR and improve its quality.

Curations submitted to Clearinghouse will present alongside the record, **without the original archived metadata being changed**. This allows the scientific community to enhance existing metadata records, for example to add information gleaned from paper supplements, or propose improved attributes that previously did not conform to standards/ontologies, without modifying the original record (often) submitted by a different user.

### Background
The Clearinghouse was developed as part of an ELIXIR project to:
- strengthen collaborations between ELIXIR resources
- improve the quality and impact of metadata, and
- build more sustainable data resources
It was initially developed to support records in the marine domain, but has since expanded to cover multiple project types, see below.
For more information please see https://elixir-europe.org/internal-projects/commissioned-services/establishment-data-clearinghouse


### The Relevancy to ENA
The Clearinghouse is deliberately set up to allow submission of new or updated metadata (related to INSDC records) originating from different sources. ENA staff have been amongst the most enthusiastic users and annotators, but have also supported other groups to submit these metadata curations. Wider enthusiasm is also growing.

## Curation objects
### Examples
Curations associated to an ENA Sample, Study, Run/Experiment and Sequence can be submitted to Clearinghouse. Below are some examples from different projects.
#### *Marine Metagenome Sample Curation:*
The following is third party annotation on https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/SAMN08012645
![Environmental metagenome curation example](./env_curation.png)
<br>
#### *SARS-CoV-2 Sequence Curation:*
The following is third party annotation on https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/OM635134
![SARS-CoV-2 curation example](./covid_curation.png)
<br>
<br>
### What happens to curations after submission to Clearinghouse?

For all public ENA/INSDC records, curations associated to them will automatically become visible alongside the record in the ENA browser, as below:

#### *Marine Metagenome Sample Curation:*
![The EEZ-name derived from the latitude and longitude](./Image_Biosample_3rdPartyCuration.png)
<br>
<br>
For **any** sample related metadata curations, cases where both attribute name and value have been validated to be compliant with ENA Checklist fields will take priority for display, and appear at the top of the 3rd Party Curations table in the browser. See below:

#### *SARS-CoV-2 Sequence Curation:*

## Programmatically querying Clearinghouse data 

The Swagger API to the Clearinghouse ([here](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/clearinghouse/api/swagger-ui/index.html#/)) allows one to do many types of query programmatically in production and [development](https://wwwdev.ebi.ac.uk/ena/clearinghouse/api/swagger-ui/index.html#/). This includes adding, modifying and removing curations, as well as querying the existing metadata in Clearinghouse, eg:
- querying via the ENA Sample ID (SAMEA####) - also known as 'recordID' to view all metadata curations associated to that sample. To date the highest proportion of Clearinghouse curations are associated to the sample record
- querying all records submitted by a particular group ('providerName')

No account is needed for read access of the Clearinghouse API. 
<br>
You may find it useful to first obtain ENA accessions for Clearinghouse queries via the ENA's own [Advanced Search API](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CwoY84MuZ3SdKYocqssumghBF88PWxUZ/edit) or [browser based Advanced Search](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/advanced-search).

Currently more complex querying of Clearinghouse data would require you to bulk download the curations from the API and process the output further.

For more technical information please refer to the [API documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y1a4xQwCddntDkmY3qq1XvxtMUZAtW0h3RhEMo3Gtho/edit#heading=h.1ksv4uv).

### Tips for querying and submitting Clearinghouse data
Think carefully about what you want to do and why. If you are submitting curations, decide which ENA record object you wish to curate based on the existing emtadata for that record. Also consider whether you have sufficient evidence for these curations.
<br>
<br>
Essentially:
* Register for either an AAP or LifeScience ID, if you do not already have one. We suggest that you obtain credentials for both test and production
* Generate a bearer token 
* Start by generating JSON files conforming to the Clearinghouse JSON format for a few test records
* Test submit these to the test instance of the Clearinghouse 
* Explore retrieving these from the test instance of the Clearinghouse (e.g. to check curations are in the expected format)
* Then generate JSON annotations conforming to the Clearinghouse JSON format for all your curation records
* Submit these to the production instance of the Clearinghouse 
* Log and examine the logs for an error and resubmit if necessary. (note: a small percentage of failures can be due timeouts, so a try/exception block in the submission scripts to wait and retry automatically can be useful)
* Explore retrieving a selection of those from the production instance of the Clearinghouse

## How is using the Clearinghouse Different from Updating Records in ENA?

It is important to differentiate between the curations submitted via the ELIXIR Clearinghouse and ENA-based metadata updates. 

* An ENA record update modifies the original public record, while a curation submitted to the Clearinghouse presents alongside the original record instead
* Only the original submitter of an ENA record can update this directly, while curations for a particular record can be submitted to the Clearinghouse by *any user* (as long as sufficient evidence is provided for how that curation was generated)
* An ENA record update requires Webin authentication, while curation submission/modification requires either AAP or LifeScience ID authentication instead
* As ENA record updates modify the original record, the modifications will propagate to EBI-based data portals (such as the Pathogens Portal, Early Cause, COVID-19 Data Portal) and be exchanged with other INSDC nodes. Curations submitted via Clearinghouse only present in the ENA browser and do not feed into other INSDC sites nor data portals.
