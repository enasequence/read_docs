# Programmatic Submission

## Introduction

Submissions of different types can be made programmatically using XML.

A receipt XML with accession numbers is provided upon successful submission. Any
validation or other errors will be written in the receipt XML as well.

## Production and test services

There are two programmatic Webin submission services. One for test submissions
and another for production submissions:

- Test service URL: https://wwwdev.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/drop-box/submit
- Production service URL: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/drop-box/submit

The test service is recreated from the full content of the production service every day at
03.00 GMT/BST. Therefore, any submissions made to the test service will be removed
by the following day.

When you are using the test service the receipt XML will contain the following message:

```xml
<INFO>This submission is a TEST submission and will be discarded within 24 hours</INFO>
```

It is advisable to first test your submissions using the Webin test service before
establishing an automated submission pipeline.

## Webin Rest V2 API

Programmatic submissions can also be made using the new Webin Rest V2 service. This has been developed to address issues such as timeout errors during submissions. The V2 API has been designed to accept submissions at 2 different endpoints, 1 synchronous and 1 asynchronous, depending on the scale of the submission. Please refer to the [Webin Rest V2 documentation](./programmatic-v2.html) to find out more.  

## Upload data files

Data files must be uploaded into a submitter specific private Webin file upload area
before they can be submitted. Always keep a local copy of the uploaded files
until the files have been successfully submitted and archived. The Webin file
upload area is a temporary transit area which is not backed up and subject to
a fair use policy.

Once uploaded, data files are submitted by referring to them from Run XML or Analysis XML.
Run XML is used for used for sequence read submissions while Analysis XML is used
for other types of submissions (e.g. genome assemblies).

More information of uploading data files and our the fair use policy is available [here](../fileprep/upload).

## Submission protocol

Submissions are made through the secure HTTPS protocol using POST multipart/form-data
according to RFC1867.

## Authentication method

Webin user name and password must be provided using basic HTTP authentication.

When using curl the user name and password are provided using the `-u` option:

```
curl -u username:password
```

## Types of XML

The type of each submitted XML file must be specified at time of submission.

When using curl each XML file is submitted using the '-F' option:

```
-F "XMLTYPE=@FILENAME"
```

where the `XMLTYPE` is one of the following POST parameters:

- `SUBMISSION` ([XML Schema](https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/ena/doc/xsd/sra_1_5/SRA.submission.xsd))
- `STUDY` ([XML Schema](https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/ena/doc/xsd/sra_1_5/SRA.study.xsd))
- `SAMPLE` ([XML Schema](https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/ena/doc/xsd/sra_1_5/SRA.sample.xsd))
- `EXPERIMENT` ([XML Schema](https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/ena/doc/xsd/sra_1_5/SRA.experiment.xsd))
- `RUN` ([XML Schema](https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/ena/doc/xsd/sra_1_5/SRA.run.xsd))
- `ANALYSIS` ([XML Schema](https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/ena/doc/xsd/sra_1_5/SRA.analysis.xsd))
- `PROJECT` ([XML Schema](https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/ena/doc/xsd/sra_1_5/ENA.project.xsd))

You can include multiple records of the same type in the same submission as part of a `SET`. For example, by grouping `SAMPLE` records in a `<SAMPLE_SET></SAMPLE_SET>`.

The maximum allowed size of a submitted XML file is 15MB. If your XML exceeds this size, please split your records into smaller XMLs and submit them across multiple submissions.

Below is an example of a sequence read data submission to the Webin test service:

```
curl -u username:password -F "SUBMISSION=@submission.xml" -F "EXPERIMENT=@experiment.xml" -F "RUN=@run.xml" "https://wwwdev.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/drop-box/submit/"
```

## Identifying objects

Each submitted object is uniquely identified within a submission account using the `alias` attribute.
Once an object has been submitted no other object of the same type can use the same alias within the
submission account. Objects can refer to other objects within a submission account by either alias or
the assigned accession number.

## Identifying submitters

The `center_name` attribute defines the submitting institution. The center name is automatically
assigned from submission account details except for broker accounts. Brokers
should provide a center name which reflects the institute where the data was generated. For brokers,
the `broker_name` field is automatically assigned at time of submission.

## Submission XML

Each submission should contain a submission XML file which defines the submission actions.
The most commonly used submission actions are listed below.

### Submission XML: submit new objects

The `ADD` action is used when submitting new objects. A corresponding submission XML
will look like:

```
<SUBMISSION>
     <ACTIONS>
         <ACTION>
             <ADD/>
         </ACTION>
    </ACTIONS>
</SUBMISSION>
```

### Submission XML: Make submitted objects public at a given date

When `HOLD` action is provided with a date then all submitted studies,
projects and samples will become immediately public on that date. Run, experiment
and analysis objects will become public on the date when studies or projects
they refer to are made public. 

A release date can be provided for studies by using the `HOLD` action together with the `ADD` action:

```
<SUBMISSION>
    <ACTIONS>
        <ACTION>
            <ADD/>
        </ACTION>
        <ACTION>
            <HOLD HoldUntilDate="TODO: release date"/>
        </ACTION>                            
    </ACTIONS>
</SUBMISSION>
```

The `HoldUntilDate` specifies the public release date of any studies submitted within the submission.
This can be at most two years in the future.

If the `HOLD` action is used without a date then the submitted studies, projects and samples will become public in two years
time.

### Submission XML: make study public

A study can be made immediately public by using `RELEASE` action with the study accession number:

```
<SUBMISSION>
    <ACTIONS>
         <ACTION>
              <RELEASE target="TODO: study accession number"/>
         </ACTION>
    </ACTIONS>
</SUBMISSION>
```

### Submission XML: update release date

You can update the release date of a study, project or sample by using the `HOLD` action with a new release date.:

```
<SUBMISSION>
    <ACTIONS>
        <ACTION>
            <HOLD target="TODO: study accession number" HoldUntilDate="TODO: YYYY-MM-DD"/>
        </ACTION>
    </ACTIONS>
</SUBMISSION>
```

This applies only to non-public studies.
It is not possible to suppress a public study by this method.

The new release date must be not more than two years in the future.

### Submission XML: Make submitted objects immediately public

IF `RELEASE` action is provided without a target attribute then all submitted studies,
projects and samples will become immediately public. 

```
<SUBMISSION>
     <ACTIONS>
         <ACTION>
             <RELEASE/>
         </ACTION>
    </ACTIONS>
</SUBMISSION>
```

Run, experiment and analysis objects will become public as long as the studies or projects they refer to are public.

### Submission XML: update existing objects

The `MODIFY` action is used when updating existing objects. A corresponding submission XML
will look like:

```
<SUBMISSION>
     <ACTIONS>
         <ACTION>
             <MODIFY/>
         </ACTION>
    </ACTIONS>
</SUBMISSION>
```

Checklist for preparing an object for update:

- The new XML for the object must either contain the original alias or the assigned accession.
- If you provide an alias then it must be given exactly as in the initial submission.
- If you provide an accession then it must be the accession number assigned to the object
in the initial submission.
- Run XML objects can't be updated to point to different data files.
- Analysis XML objects can't be updated to point to different data files.

Below is an extract of an study XML which contains an accession number:

```
<STUDY accession="ERP000011">
   ...       
</STUDY>
 ```

Below is an extract of an study XML which contains an alias:

```
<STUDY alias="study1">
   ...       
</STUDY>
```

### Submission XML: validate objects

The `VALIDATE` action is used when validating a submission without actually creating or
updating any objects. It can be used together with the `ADD` action (default):

```
<SUBMISSION>
     <ACTIONS>
         <ACTION>
             <ADD/>
         </ACTION>
         <ACTION>
             <VALIDATE/>
         </ACTION>
    </ACTIONS>
</SUBMISSION>
```

Or with the `MODIFY` action:

```
<SUBMISSION>
     <ACTIONS>
         <ACTION>
             <MODIFY/>
         </ACTION>
         <ACTION>
             <VALIDATE/>
         </ACTION>
    </ACTIONS>
</SUBMISSION>
```

### Submission XML: cancel objects

Pre-publication private objects (with the exception of assemblies) can be cancelled by all submitters.

To cancel objects, you must use the `CANCEL` action in the submission XML.

The `CANCEL` action should point to the object that is being cancelled. Please note
that the `CANCEL` action will be propagated from studies to all associated experiments
 and analyses, and from experiments to all associated runs.

Below is an example of a submission XML used to cancel objects:

```
<SUBMISSION>
    <ACTIONS>
        <ACTION>
            <CANCEL target="TODO: object accession number"/>
        </ACTION>
    </ACTIONS>
</SUBMISSION>
```

### Submission XML: request a receipt XML

The `RECEIPT` action can be used to request a receipt XML issued as a result of an `ADD` action
that contains all the issued accession numbers. This is especially useful in cases where the
submission request times out before it has as completed. The submission process will continue
nevertheless and the issued accession numbers can be later requested using the `RECEIPT` action.

```
SUBMISSION_SET>
    <SUBMISSION>
        <ACTIONS>
            <ACTION>
                <RECEIPT target="submission alias or accessions"/>
           </ACTION>          
       </ACTIONS>
    </SUBMISSION>
</SUBMISSION_SET>
```

### Submission actions without submission XML

Some submission actions can be defined using the `ACTION` POST parameter.
If the `ACTION` parameter is provided then the submission XML
will be ignored.

You can use the following actions in place of submission XML:

- `ACTION=ADD`: create new objects in the archive
- `ACTION=MODIFY`: update existing objects in the archive
- `ACTION=VALIDATE` (same as `ACTION=VALIDATE,ADD`)
- `ACTION=VALIDATE,ADD`: validate new objects without creating them
- `ACTION=VALIDATE,MODIFY`: validate update of existing objects without updating them

In addition, you can use the following POST parameters with the `ACTION` parameter:

- `HOLD_DATE`: set the public release date for a new study or sample
- `CENTER_NAME`: set the submitting center name (mandatory for brokers)  

For example, submit a new analysis:
```
curl -u username:password -F "ACTION=ADD" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/drop-box/submit/" -F "ANALYSIS=@analysis.xml"
```

or submit a new study with a public release date:
```
curl -u username:password -F "HOLD_DATE=31-11-2019"  -F "ACTION=ADD" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/drop-box/submit/" -F "PROJECT=@project.xml"
```

## Receipt XML

Once a submission has been processed a receipt XML ([XML Schema](https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/ena/doc/xsd/sra_1_5/SRA.receipt.xsd))
is returned.

To know if the submission was successful look in the first line of the `<RECEIPT>` block.

The attribute `success` will have value `true` or `false`. If the value
is false then the submission did not succeed. In this case check the rest of
the receipt for error messages and after making corrections, try the submission again.

If the success attribute is true then the submission was successful. The receipt will
contain the accession numbers of the objects that you have submitted. In the case of
a study submission this is likely to be the accession that you will be including in a
publication.

An example of a successful run submission:

```
<RECEIPT receiptDate="2014-12-02T16:06:20.871Z" success="true">
    <RUN accession="ERR049536" alias="run_1" status="PRIVATE"/>
    <SUBMISSION accession="ERA390457" alias="submission_1"/>
    <ACTIONS>ADD</ACTIONS>
</RECEIPT>
```

Above, the assigned run accession number `ERR049536` is provided in the `accession` attribute
within the `RUN` block.  

If the submission was not successful the Receipt XML will contain the error messages within
the `MESSAGES` block:

```
<RECEIPT receiptDate="2014-12-02T16:06:20.871Z" success="false">
   ...
   <MESSAGES>
      <ERROR>This is an error message.</ERROR>
   </MESSAGES>
   ...
</RECEIPT>
```

## Retrieving submitted XMLs

Submitted XMLs can be retrieved from the submission service using the assigned
accession numbers. This can be a helpful, for example, as a starting point for making
modifications to the submitted objects.

Please substitute `<accession>` with the assigned accession number in the URLs below:

- Project XML: `https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/drop-box/projects/<accession>`
- Study XML: `https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/drop-box/studies/<accession>`
- Sample XML: `https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/drop-box/samples/<accession>`
- Run XML: `https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/drop-box/runs/<accession>`
- Experiment XML: `https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/drop-box/experiments/<accession>`
- Analysis XML: `https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/drop-box/analyses/<accession>`
