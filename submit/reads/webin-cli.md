## Prepare the files

The set of files that are part of the submission are specified using a manifest file.
The manifest file is specified using the `-manifest <filename>` option.

A sequence read submission consists of the following files:

- 1 manifest file
- 1 BAM file, 1 CRAM file, or 1-2 Fastq files

### Manifest file

The manifest file has two columns separated by a tab (or any whitespace characters):
- Field name (first column): case insensitive field name   
- Field value (second column): field value

The following metadata fields are supported in the manifest file:

- STUDY: Study accession or unique name (alias) 
- SAMPLE: Sample accession or unique name (alias)
- NAME: Unique experiment name
- PLATFORM: [See permitted values](#platform). Not needed if INSTRUMENT is provided.
- INSTRUMENT: [See permitted values](#instrument)
- INSERT_SIZE: Insert size for paired reads
- LIBRARY_NAME: Library name (optional)
- LIBRARY_SOURCE: [See permitted values](#source)
- LIBRARY_SELECTION: [See permitted values](#selection)
- LIBRARY_STRATEGY: [See permitted values](#strategy)
- DESCRIPTION: free text library description (optional) 

The following file name fields are supported in the manifest file:

- BAM: Single BAM file
- CRAM: Single CRAM file
- FASTQ: Single fastq file

For example, the following manifest file represents a paired Fastq submission:

```

## CRAM file validation

### Reference sequence validation

Reference sequences in CRAM files are required to exists in ENA's CRAM reference registry.

The Webin command line submission interface maintains two file based caches
to avoid unnecessary calls to the registry:
1. Cache for reference sequence checksums
2. Cache for reference sequences

The cache for reference sequence checksums is stored in the `$HOME/.webin-cli/cram-ref-info` directory,
where `$HOME` is the home directory for the user executing the program.
 
The cache for reference sequences is configured using the `REF_PATH` and `REF_CACHE` environmental 
variables as in [samtools](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools.html).
