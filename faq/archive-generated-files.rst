Archive Generated Run Files
===========================

Whenever possible, ENA provides access to two types of file for each run we
present: the submitted file(s) and archive-generated file(s). Both are visible
in the ENA Browser view for runs:

.. image:: images/archive-generated-files-p01.png

This page serves to briefly discuss the reason for this and the differences
between the submitted and archive-generated files.


Submitted Files
===============

The submitted files for any given run are copies of the files originally
provided to us by the submitter.
These files always undergo validation appropriate to their format, and are
presented as-submitted with no automated curation.
Formats are varied, and may be FASTQ but could also be others including BAM,
FAST5, HDF5, etc.


Archive-Generated Files
=======================

Providing archive-generated FASTQs for runs is a means of bringing some
consistency to the data we provide.
By imposing a level of uniformity on these files, we can ensure users know
what to expect of them and may incorporate them into pipelines with minimal
friction.

Note that archive-generated FASTQ will not be available in the following
uncommon scenarios:

- BAM/CRAM files containing @PG:longranger
- BAM/CRAM files containing @PG:cellranger
- BAM/CRAM files containing CB:Z,CR:Z,CY:Z,RX:Z,QX:Z tags
- Complete genomics native (data folder) submissions
- PacBio native (HDF5) submissions
- Many ONT native format submissions

Generated FASTQ Files
---------------------

The number of files generated and their content varies depending on the nature
of the submitted files

| <run accession> | | The run accession. A spot is identified uniquely by the combination      |

| <read index>    | | A positive integer assigned to the application reads in the order in     |
|                 | | which they appear in the spot: /1 for first application read and /2 for  |
|                 | | the second application read. In cases where the read name is missing or  |
