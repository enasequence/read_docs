Updating Assemblies
===================

Updates to assemblies can be performed through `Webin-CLI <general-guide/webin-cli.html>`_, and result in the creation of a new version of the assembly.

Updates to assemblies are performed in very similar fashion to submission of assemblies.
It is therefore sufficient to follow the guidance in the `assembly submission <assembly>`_ pages, while considering the below factors:

**Study and sample reference must be maintained:**
To submit an assembly update, make sure you reference the same study and sample accessions as were used in the original submission.
In fact, this study-sample pair is unique to your assembly and is the means by which you submission is recognised as an update rather than a new assembly.

**Annotation status must be maintained:**
If your assembly was previously submitted with annotation and you are updating the assembly you can do this following the above factors, i.e. maintaining the study and sample, and adding an updated assembly including annotation.

If your assembly did not originally include annotation, it is not possible to update your assembly with annotation.
An unannotated assembly can only be updated with new versions of the same unannotated assembly.
In order to add annotation to a previously unannotated assembly you need to re-submit the assembly.
Note this will result in new accession numbers.
Please contact the helpdesk via datasubs@ebi.ac.uk to request suppression of the existing assembly version.

**Some metadata can be updated:**
However, not all can. Please contact datasubs@ebi.ac.uk for queries about this topic.

**State of publicity will be the same:**
If the original assembly is already public, then the update will be made public as soon as processing is complete.
However, please be aware that this process can take some time to complete, and you should allow at least a week after successful submission for your update to be apparent.

**Metagenomic Assemblies:**
Primary and binned metagenome assemblies cannot be updated.
If you wish to update one of these assemblies, please email datasubs@ebi.ac.uk so that we can suppress the existing version.
MAG assemblies work the same as isolate assemblies in the context of updates.
